# Binge Show Calculator

## Description

We all like to watch tv shows and sometimes binge watch the entire show at once. When you start watching a tv show it is hard to know how long the show will take to complete.
Binge Show calculator is an application that allows for users to search for a tv show that they are interested in and get information regarding the total runtime of the show. The application will go through all the seasons and episodes for the show and get the total time it would take to complete the show.
In the homepage the user is presented with five featured shows and they can always search for any other shows.
In addition to this, the user can also learn more about the show including the creators, genres, casts, and also view the trailer for the show in the details page.
